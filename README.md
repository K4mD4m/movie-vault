## üîêEnvironment Variables (`.env.local`)

To enable communication with TMDb and Firebase services, you need to configure your `.env.local` file with the necessary API keys.

### Step 1: Get TMDb API Key

1. Register or log in to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Go to your profile and open the API section [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
3. Generate a new API key.

### Step 2: 

1. Go to Firebase Console and create a project. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google provider).
3. Create a Firestore database

### Step 3: Configure the .env.local File

   ```bash
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```
`üîÅ Replace the placeholder values with the actual Firebase configuration from your project settings.`



### Step 4: Run the Application

After setting up `.env.local`, the app can connect to both the TMDb API and Firebase services.
